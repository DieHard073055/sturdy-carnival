### What is a VPC
This of a VPC as a virtual data centre in the cloud.

### AWS Definition
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.

You can easily customize the network configuration for your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud. For example, you can create a public-facing subnet  for your webservers that has access to the Internet, and place your backend systems such as databases, or application servers in a private facing subnet with no Internet access. You can leverage multiple layers of security, including security groups and network access control lists, to help control access to Amazon EC2 Instances in each subnet.

Additionally You can create Hardware Virtual Private Cloud (VPN) connection between your coorporate datacenter and your VPC and leverage the AWS cloud as an extension of your corporate datacenter.

### What can you do with VPC?
* Launch instances into a subnet of your choosing.
* Assign Custom IP address range in each subnet.
* Configure routing tables between subnets.
* Create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC.
* Much better security control over the AWS resources.
* Instance security groups.
* Subnet network access control lists (ACLS).

### Default VPC vs Custom VPC
* Default VPC is user friendly, allowing you to immedietely deploy instances.
* All Subnets in the default VPC have a route out to the internet.
* Each EC2 instance has both public and private IP address.
    * If we deploy the instance to a private VPC subnet, the instance will not have any public IP address.

### VPC Peering
* Allows you to connect one VPC with another via direct network route using private IP address.
* Instances behave as if they were on the same private network.
* You can peer VPC's with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPC's in the same account.
* Peering is in a star configuration: ie 1 central VPC peers with 4 others. **No Transitive Peering!!**.

### Exam Tips
* Think of VPC as a logical datacenter in AWS.
* Consists of IGWs (Or Virtual Private Gateways), Route Tables, Network Access Control Lists, Subnets, and Security Groups.
* 1 Subnet = 1 Availability Zone
* Security Groups are Stateful; Network Access Control Lists are Stateless.
* No Transitive peering.
