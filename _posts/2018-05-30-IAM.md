# Identity Access Management 101

### What is IAM
An AWS service which is dedicated to manage users and fine tune their level of access to the AWS console. Mainly used for the administration and management of user access.

### What does IAM give you
* Centralised control of your AWS account.
* Shared Access to your AWS account.
* Granular Permissions.
* Identity Federation ( including active directory, facebook, linkedin etc ).
* Multifactor Authentication.
* Provide temporary access for users/devices and services where necessary.
* Allows you to setup your own password rotation policy.
* Integrates with many different AWS services
* Support PCI DSS Compliance

### Critical Terms
* User - End Users ( poeple )
* Groups - A collection of users under one set of permissions.
* Roles - You create roles and assign them to AWS resources. ( ie EC2 instance )
* Policies - A document that defines one or more permissions ( can be attached to all 3 above )


### Security Token Service ( STS )
Grants users limited and temporary access to AWS resources. Users can come from three sources:
* Federation ( typically active directory )
    * Uses Security Assertion Markup Language ( SAML )
    * Grants temporary access based off the users Active Directory Credentials. Does not need to be a user in IAM.
    * Single sign on allows users to log into AWS console without assigning IAM credentails.
* Federation with Mobile Apps
    * Use Facebook/Amazon/Google or other OpenID providers to login.
* Cross Account Access
    * Let users from one AWS account access resources in another.

### Understanding Key Terms

* **Federation:** Combining or joining a list of users in one domain ( such as IAM ) with a list of users in another domain ( such as Active Directory, Facebook, etc )
* **Identity Broker:** A service that allows you to take an identity from point A and join it ( *federate it* ) to point B.
* **Identity Store:** Services like Active Directory, Facebook, Google etc.
* **Identities:** a user of a service like Facebook etc.

### Exam answer format

##### Scenario 1 

1. Develop an Identity Broker to communicate with LDAP and AWS STS.
2. Identity Broker always authenticates with LDAP first, then with AWS STS.
3. Application then gets temporary access to AWS resources.

##### Scenario 2

1. Develop an Identity Broker to communicate with LDAP and AWS STS.
2. Identity Broker always authenticates with LDAP first, gets an IAM Role associated with the user.
3. Application then authenticates with STS and assumes that IAM Role.
4. Application uses that IAM role to interact with S3.
