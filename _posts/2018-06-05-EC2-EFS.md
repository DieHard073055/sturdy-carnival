### Elastic File System

Aws elastic file system, is a storage service for EC2 instances. EFS is easy to use and provides a simple interface that allows users to create and configure file systems quickly and easily. With aws EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files so your applications have storage always when they need it.

* Supports the Network File System Version 4 (NFSv4) protocol.
* You only pay for the storage you use ( no pre-provisioning required ).
* Can scale upto petabytes.
* Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections.
* Data is stored across multiple Availability Zones within a region.
* Read after Write consistency.
* Block based storage, not object based storage.

### Creating a EFS Volume
The way how it connects to EC2 instances is through your VPC. If you do not have any custom VPC's you can connect them to the default VPC's for the availability zones in your region. 
1. Select the VPC you want to connect the EFS to.
2. Check the availability zones you want to assign them to.
3. On the availability zones, select the subnets you want them on, add the ip address you want it to have, and also attach the security groups for it.
4. Add the tags.
5. After reviewing it, Create the File System.
