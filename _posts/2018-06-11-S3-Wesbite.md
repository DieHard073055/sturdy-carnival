Hosting static content with S3:
* Create a bucket with a name you would like.
* Goto bucket properties and select static website hosting. 
    * You would want to select the option `Use this bucket to host a website`. Select the name for the index document and the error document. 
    * You can add in the redirection rules if you have any. 
    * Hit save. 
* When you upload your files make sure you enable public read access on your file.
    * You website will return Access denied XML file otherwise.

You website will be available at http://[bucketname].s3-website-[region].amazonaws.com.
* Easiest way to break this website is to disable the public read access.


### CORS
in order for your static website in one bucket to access another javascript/css/images on another bucket. You need to go to the bucket with resources.
* Click on bucket permissions.
* Select CORS configuration from the dropdown list.
* in the line which says `<AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>` replace the * with the URL of the website that will be accessing these resources.
* That will prevent all the errors caused by CORS not being configured.
