    <ul>
  <li>DNS is used to convert human friendly names, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://google.com</code> into an Internet Protocol Address such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://92.93.94.95</code>.</li>
  <li>IP addresses are used by computers to identify each other on the network. IP addresses commonly come in 2 different forms, IPv4 and IPv6.</li>
  <li>IPv4 address space is a 32 bit field and has over 4 billion different addresses.</li>
  <li>IPv6 address space is a 128 bit field and has over 340 undecillion addresses.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="top-level-domains">Top Level Domains</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The last word in a domain name represents the “top level domain”.
    <ul>
      <li>.com</li>
      <li>.edu</li>
      <li>.gov</li>
      <li>.me</li>
      <li>.io</li>
      <li>.org</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The second word in a domain name represents the second level domain name” <em>optional and depends on the domain.</em>
    <ul>
      <li>.<strong>co</strong>.uk</li>
      <li>.<strong>gov</strong>.uk</li>
      <li>.<strong>com</strong>.au</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="domain-registrars">Domain Registrars</h3>
<p>A registrar is an authority that can assign domain names directly under one or more top-level domains. These domains are registered with InterNIC, a service of ICANN, which enforces uniqueness of domain names across the Internet. Each domain name becomes registered in a central database known as the WhoIS database.</p>

<h3 id="soa-records">SOA Records</h3>
<p><strong>Start Of Authrority Records</strong></p>

<p><em>The SOA Record Stores Information About</em>;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The name of the server that supplied the data for the zone.</li>
  <li>The administrator of the zone.</li>
  <li>The current version of the zone.</li>
  <li>The number of seconds a secondary name server should wait before checking for updates.</li>
  <li>The number of seconds a secondary name server should wait before retrying a failed zone transfer.</li>
  <li>The maximum number of seconds that a secondary name server can use data before it must either be refreshed or expire.</li>
  <li>The default number of seconds for the time-to-live file on resource records.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ns-records">NS Records</h3>
<ul>
  <li>NS stands for Name Server Records.</li>
  <li>Used by Top Level Domain servers to direct traffic to Content DNS server which contains authoritative DNS records.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-records">A Records</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The A record is the fundemental type of DNS record and the “A” in A record stands for “Address”.</li>
  <li>The A record is used by a computer to translate the name of the domain to the IP address.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Elastic load balancers never have an IPv4 / IPv6 Address, they always have a DNS name.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="ttl-record">TTL Record</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The length that a DNS record is cached on either the Resolving Server or the users own local PC is equal to the value of the “Time To Live” (TTL) in seconds.</li>
  <li>The lower the time to live, the faster changes to DNS records take to propagate through the internet.</li>
  <li>When migrating to different servers, always remember to lower the TTL to 300 seconds ( 5 minutes ) since 2 days before the migration, since by default the TTL is set to 2 days.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cnames">CNAMES</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A Canonical Name ( CName ) can be used to resolve one domain name to another.</li>
  <li>For example, you may have a mobile website with the domain name http://m.acloud.guru that is used for when users browse to your domain name on their mobile devices. You may also want the name http://mobile.acloud.guru to resolve this same address.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alias-records">Alias Records</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Alias Records are used to map resource record sets in your hosted zone to Elastic Load Balancers, CloudFront distributions, or S3 buckets that are configured as websites.</li>
  <li>Alias Records work like CNAME record in that you can map one DNS name (www.example.com) to another <code class="highlighter-rouge">target</code> DNS name (elb1234.elb.amazonaws.com).</li>
  <li>Key difference - A CNAME cant be used for naked domain names (zone apex record)</li>
  <li>You cant have a CNAME for http://acloud.guru, it must be either an A record or an Alias.</li>
  <li>Alias resource record sets can save you time because Amazon Route53 automatically recognizes changes in the record sets that the alias resource record set refers to.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="exam-tips">Exam Tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>ELB’s do not have a predefined public IPv4 addresses, you resolve them using a DNS name.</li>
  <li>Understand the difference between as Alias Record and a CNAME.</li>
  <li>Given the choice always choose an Alias Record over a CNAME.</li>
</ul>
