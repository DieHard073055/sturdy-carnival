        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Snowball
    <ul>

      <li>Snowball Edge - Both Compute and Storage Capabilities</li>
      <li>Snowmobile - 100PB worth of storage</li>
      <li>Understand what snowball is</li>
      <li>Understand what Import/Export is</li>
      <li>Snowball can import / Export to S3</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>S3 Transfer Acceleration
    <ul>
      <li>You can speed up S3 transfer speeds using CloudFront Edge locations, so you can upload files to s3 faster. Extra costs will apply. Greatest Impact on people who are further away geographically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>S3 static websites.
    <ul>
      <li>You can S3 to host static websites.</li>
      <li>Serverless</li>
      <li>Very Cheap, scales automatically.</li>
      <li>Static only, cannot host dynamic sites.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>CORS
    <ul>
      <li>Cross origin resource sharing</li>
      <li>Needed to enable cors on the resources bucket and state the URL for the origin that will be calling the bucket.</li>
      <li>Remeber to use the S3 website url and not the bucket URL, website url has the word website on it.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When you do a PUT object on S3 you will get a HTTP 200 success code.</li>
  <li>You can load files much faster by enabling multipart upload.</li>
  <li>Read the S3 FAQ!</li>
