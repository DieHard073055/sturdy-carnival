  <li>It is Object based storage.</li>
  <li>The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="s3-basics">S3 basics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Object based storage i.e allows you to upload files.</li>
  <li>Files can be from 0 Byte to 5 TB.</li>
  <li>There is unlimited storage.</li>
  <li>Files are stored in buckets.</li>
  <li>S3 is a universal namespace, that is names must be unique globally.</li>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>* Storage
* Requests
* Storage Management Pricing
* Data Transfer pricing
* Transfer acceleration
    * Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration Enables Fast, easy and secure transfer of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.
